Path Traversal
-	Application Code
-	Credentials for back-end systems
-	Sensitive operating system files
1.	Reading arbitrary files via path traversal
a.	Filename = ../../../etc/passwd
2.	Absolute path
a.	Filename = /etc/passwd
3.	Sequence blocked with absolute path bypass
a.	Filename = ….//….//….//etc/passwd (or)
b.	Filename = ….\/….\/….\/etc/passwd
4.	Multipart data blocked(../../../)
a.	Filename = %2e%2e%2f (or)
b.	Filename = %252e%252e%252f(fuzzing traversal)
5.	Should start with the base folder
a.	Filename = /var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd
6.	Extension should be same
a.	Filename = ../../../etc/passwd%00.png
How to Prevent.?
-	Validate the user input before processing.
-	Avoid giving access to the user inputs.
-	After validating verify the cononicalized path starts with the expected directory.
